This is a simple one-class sketch that demonstrates a basic picture editing software created using Processing (Java). The sketch has two options for editing an image : Applying filters or using the effects as a circular or rectangular brush.

The effects demonstrated are the "blur effect", "sepia effect" and "posterization effect". All effects are generated using simple algorithms that benifit from Processing's native pixel libraries.
